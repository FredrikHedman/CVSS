 The ``vulnerability``module
============================

The VulnerabilityVector class encapsulates the concept of a
vulnerability vector as decribed in the
[CVSS Guide.](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html)

Intialize the class with a string conaining a vulnerability vector.
The operations help in checking, modifying and using the vector.

    >>> from vulnerability import VulnerabilityVector

    >>> s1 = "AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:C"
    >>> v1 = VulnerabilityVector(s1)
    >>> v1 == v1.valid()
    True


Too short and too long should raise an exception
------------------------------------------------

    >>> s1 = "AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:C"
    >>> v1 = VulnerabilityVector(s1)
    >>> v1.complete()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    vulnerability.InvalidBaseVector: wrong number of elements in vector

    >>> s1 = "AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:C/X:Y"
    >>> v1 = VulnerabilityVector(s1)
    >>> v1.complete()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    vulnerability.InvalidBaseVector: X not a metric
