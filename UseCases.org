* Use Cases
** A first-time user wants to take cvss.py out for a spin.
*** As a User
 1. The user invokes the program via the commandline.
 2. The program responds with the help synopsis.
*** How to test
    TBD


** Calculate a CVSS Base score for a discovered vulnerability
*** As a User
 1. The user invokes the program via the commandline.
 2. It is immediately obvious from the output of the program what
    command line options to specify.
 3. The user specifies the command line parameters for a Base score
    calculation.
 4. The program asks questions for the Base score calculation. No more,
    no less.
 5. The program responds with
    1. How it interpreted the user's input
    2. The Base score for the vulnerability
    3. The CVSS string.
*** How to test
    TBD


** Calculate CVSS Temporal and Environmental scores
   for a known vulneratiblity, for which the CVSS Base string can be
   found in a vulnerability database.
*** As a User
 1. The user invokes the program via the commandline.
 2. It is immediately obvious from the output of the program what
    command line options to specify.
 3. The user specifies the known CVSS string and command line parameters
    for Temporal and/or Environmental score calculation.
 4. The program asks for the Temporal and Environmental input. No more,
    no less.
 5. The progam responds with
    1. How it interpreted the user's input
    2. The Base, Temporal, Environmental and Overall scores
    3. The CVSS string
*** How to test
    TBD


** Calculate Base score from CVSS Base string
*** As a User
 A user wants to calculate the Base score for a vulnerability, for which
 there already exists a CVSS Base string

 1. The user invokes the program via the commandline.
 2. It is immediately obvious from the output of the program what command line options to specify.
 3. The user specifies the command line paramteras and the CVSS Base string
 4. The program responds with
    1. How it interpreted the user's input
    2. The Base score for the vulnerability
    3. The CVSS string.
*** How to test
    TBD


** A user specifies an erroneous CVSS string
*** As a User
 1. The user invokes the program via the commandline.
 2. It is immediately obvious from the output of the program what command line options to specify.
 3. The user specifies the command line paramteras and the erroneous CVSS string
 4. The program responds with
    1. How it interpreted the data
    2. ... indicating what it did and did not interpret correctly.
 5. The user understands, based on the output, what part of the CVSS String is incorrectly specified.
*** How to test
    TBD



** An Emacs user wants to generate a properly formatted CVSS string
An Emacs user wants to generate a properly formatted CVSS string, and
associated scores, for insertion into a document. The user wants the
inserted text to be properly formatted.
*** As a User
 1. The user invokes an Emacs function for calculating either Base or
    Base + Temporal and Environmental scores.
 2. Emacs asks the relevant questions.
 3. A properly formatted output, for the specific mode of the current
    buffer in Emacs, is inserted at the insertion point.
*** How to test
    TBD


** [?] An Emacs user wants to modify the way the inserted text is generated.
*** Status
    Clairification needed.
*** As a User
 1. The user modifies a mode-template file, using specific syntax to
    specify substitution fields and boilerplate text, headings and so
    forth.
*** How to test
    TBD


** [?] Support for a a new Emacs mode
An Emacs user wants to add support for a mode for which the noble
programmers of CVSS could not foresee the usage of.
*** Status
    Clairification needed.
*** As a User 
 1. The user adds a mode-template file, using a file naming scheme, so
    that the correct template is chosen for the "new" mode.
 2. The user modifies the mode-template file, using specific syntax to
    specify substitution fields and boilerplate text, headings and so
    forth.
*** How to test
    TBD
