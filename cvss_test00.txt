Basic tests
===========

>>> from metric import cvs_factory
>>> from cvss import CommonVulnerabilityScore

>>> selected = [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2]
>>> cvs = cvs_factory(CommonVulnerabilityScore, selected)
>>> print(round(cvs.exploitability, 1))
10.0
>>> print(cvs.fcn(1.2))
1.176
>>> print(cvs.base_score)
7.8
>>> selected = [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2]
>>> cvs = cvs_factory(CommonVulnerabilityScore, selected)
>>> print(cvs.base_score)
7.8
>>> print(round(cvs.impact,1))
6.9
